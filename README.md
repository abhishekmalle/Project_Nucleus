# Project Nucleus

A GT Agency project for the Data Science Bowl 2018 competition.

## Getting Started

You can clone this repository by using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/gtagency/Project_Nucleus.git
```

To work with these project files, you will need a working installation of Python
and a few packages, listed in `requirements.txt`.

If you do not have a Python installation, you first need to download and install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (preferably Python 3), and then get the needed packages through one of the following suggested options:

* Install and use `virtualenv` to create a virtual environment for your Python packages;

* Install and use `conda`, a Python package manager that installs packages in their own folder;

* Install and use `pip3`, setting up packages without a virtual environment.

If you are using `pip3`, just use `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` from within your cloned folder to obtain the required packages.

Note: If you choose the last option and your computer runs macOS, it comes with Python 2 included. However, there are several pre-installed packages that cannot be modified by `pip`, even with privileged access through `sudo`. For this reason, you will probably want to use `pip3`, as it will avoid conflicts with the default Apple tools.

Since Python 2 and Python 3 packages are installed separately, you will need to make sure you are using the version of Python for which you installed the needed packages. So, if you installed them with `pip3`, you'll want to run, for instance, `python3 data_converter.py`.
